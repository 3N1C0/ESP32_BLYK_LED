The goal of this project is to gain overall understanding of connecting a BLYK App to and ESP32 Board.

Step 1: Set up LED by connecting anode of LED to a resistor then a pin of your choice, then connect the cathode to GND

Step 2: Make a simple BLYK application with a button that connects to a Virtual Pin (Virtual Pin 0) So wehn it is pressed it can send those results to the ESP32 

Step 3: Run the code attached to this repository so when you press the button the LED turns on and off
